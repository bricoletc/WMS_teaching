====================
Fill in  a workflow
====================

We have a workflow with missing information in some rules, marked as ``???``. The goal is to fill them in. 

There are two flavours of the workflow. Start with the fixme file in the ``easier`` folder; the one in the ``harder`` folder is more involved.


Test what you filled in works by using the ``-n`` flag. 

Actually run using

.. code-block:: shell

    snakemake --use-conda -j 4 

The ``--use-conda`` directive is not actually needed here, but can be used to build custom conda environments for specific rules.
In this case the environment we created contains everything needed for all rules already.
