====================
Fill in  a workflow
====================

Now that you know the syntax of Snakemake we want to test your 
understanding of Snakemake before we come to our large task.

For this we created a small workflow but it misses a few line of
input and output of some rule.

Please fill in the gaps.

You can find the file in the P2 folder of the git.


In the end you should be able to run the workflow without issues
if you use snakemake with conda to launch it:

.. code-block:: shell

    snakemake --use-conda -j 4
