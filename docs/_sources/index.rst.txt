Workflow management systems 
========================================

Welcome! We hope you will learn from this workshop and enjoy it also.

The aim is to understand how to read & write a pipeline using a workflow management system (WMS).

Hopefully after this workshop you will have in mind a situation where you could have used such a tool,
and will recognise future situations where it will come in handy.
