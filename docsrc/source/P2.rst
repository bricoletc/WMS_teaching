====================
Fill in  a workflow
====================

Now that you know the syntax of Snakemake we want to test your 
understanding of Snakemake before we come to a larger project.

For this we created two small workflows which miss a few pieces of information
in some rules.

Please fill in the gaps inside the P2 folder of the git repo.

You should start with the fixme file in the ``easier`` folder first- the ``harder`` one has a more complex workflow
and is not the primary goal.

In the end you should be able to run the workflow without issues
if you use snakemake to launch it:

.. code-block:: shell

    snakemake --use-conda -j 4

The ``--use-conda`` directive is not actually needed here, but can be used to build custom conda environments for specific rules.
In this case the environment we created contains everything needed for all rules already.
